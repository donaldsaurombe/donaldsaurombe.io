      <p>Dani and I first met in 2015 and we remained friends since then. We
        started seeing each other more often in 2018 and during those encounters
        it became clear to me that I was ready to get serious with her. </p>
        <p> I am 30 years old, from Zimbabwe and have been based in the
        Philippines since 2007. I cam here as a student and ended up settling
      here. I cofounded a tech startup that developed and operates the mobile
    for parking called, Dibz.</p>

          Coordinator of the Young Women's Leadership Program at the Women and
        Gender Institute. She is also taking up her graduate studies- working

      Philippines Diliman.</p>
