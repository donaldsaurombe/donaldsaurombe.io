      <h3 class="post-tittle">The Day He Met My Dad</h3>
      <div class="post-contet">
        <p>I met Don in 2015. Years of friendship was capped in 2018 where i realized he had
boyfriend potential.I believe i had known him well enough to be worthy of meeting my
parents.</p>
<p>December 22 I dropped a hint that my family and I will be doing our Christmas
 shopping. Just as i had hoped, he also decided to do his.</p>
<p>We were in Yayoi, a Japanese restaurant, for lunch. Donald texted me saying
he was in the vicinity, i told him so was I and he should come meet my Father
and sisters. I can tell he was nervous, stiff, very formal but beautifully
serene on the outside nonetheless. I was only a little nervous but regardless,
i silently prayed everything goes well.</p>
<p>My father was polite, my sisters intrigued. They KNEW he was the one right
off the bat. It was quite embarrassing how they were so giddy.</p>
<p>My dad asked me THE question. Thankfully Iâ€™ve rehearsed it in my head a
million times. I met him in CBTL, Katipunan on a plain day i was there to
study. Thankfully there was a lack of sockets, i asked to table with him so
i can charge my laptop and get some work done.</p>
<p>This turned into a conversation, leading to numbers exchanged and the rest
 was history. I kept in touch to ask him on things like investing, politics,
but also probing at his interests, values, principles. I am sure he stayed in
touch for the same reason. Honestly, he was an open book of feelings.</p>
<p>The meetup in Yayoi was fairly short. Dad ordered a mango shake for him,
offered food, and had a small conversation on Christmas gifts to get,
especially because he was out to look for a cellphone for his brother as we
were for my mother.</p>
<p>We walked out there together. Said out awkward goodbyes by the entrance
(he smelled sooo nice) and I could hear nothing but the blood pumping in my
ears. I felt lightheaded and kind of dizzy yet exhilarated with adrenaline
at what had just happened: they met my future.</p>

    <h3 class="post-tittle">Meeting Her Dad</h3>
    <div class="post-contet">
      <p>Dani and I first met in <strong>2015</strong> and we remained friends since then. We
        started seeing each other more often in 2018 and during those encounters
        it became clear to me that I was ready to get serious with her. </p>
        <p> On one random afternoon of December 2018 as I was begiining to do my
          Chrristmas shopping, we started texting and realized we were both in
          Megamall at that time. I was doing some window shopping and Dani,
          along with her dad and sisters, were having lunch at a Japanese
          restaurant</p>
          <p> If my memory serves me right-before you begin judging me for
            being unsure just know that this moment quickly turned into a
            cold sweats kinda moment..- Dani asked me if I would like to meet
            her dad and her sisters. That caught me totally off-guard but my
            insticnts told me that this was a make it or break it sort of moment
            and I had to put aside all fears and step up to this challenge with
            her</p>
            <p> I was in <a href="https://www.zara.com/ph">Zara</a>, which was
               right opposite the restaurant they were in and I tried to assess
                the situation from where I was ( by that I mean check to see how
               fearsome her dad is) but they were out of view. I said a short
             prayer and began walking while I called her on the phone so she
              could come and meet me at the entrance, which  she did.</p>
                <p> we hugged, then she walked me over to where her family were
                sitting. I greeted her dad and her sisters. Her dad was friendly
                and welcoming and her sisters were struggling to hide their
                intrigue.- I can imagine they had a lot of questions to ask Dani
                and they were probably teasing her with facial expressions
                whenever I wasn't looking.</p>
                <p>I didn't eat much though her dad was kind enough to offer to
                order more food for me but I politely declined. I just shared
                in what they had aready ordered. Her dad then popped the
                question, 'so how did you and Dani meet?' I believe she was
                the one that answered that one.</p>
                <p> We then wrapped up and said our goodbyes. There were a few
                  awkward beso moments with <em>Ysa</em> and <em>Angela</em> but that aside, it
                  couldn't have gone any better.</p>
